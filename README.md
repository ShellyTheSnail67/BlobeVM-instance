# BlobeVM-instance
Codespace VM (computer only)
create a new repository (if youre me, you can use this one), then create a new codespace to that repository. while in the codespace, type this into the terminal:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blobby-Boi/BlobeVM/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
then, wait for it to download and then click install
apparently, you have to wait some time but then you go into the ports tab in the terminal and open the url to the open port.
enjoy your web vm!
